The code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures in the thesis can be seen in this repository. <br>
One jupyter notebook includes the code for each section in the results. Methods which were used repeatedly are contained in extra notebooks.

df: DataFrame containing the MaxQuant evidence data. This DataFrame is used as the basis for the analysis and predictions.
df_comp: DataFrame containing the MaxQuant evidence data, as well as the prediction for every row. Additional columns with the error of the CCS and the 1/K0 are included as well.
